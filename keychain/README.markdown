keychain.py
===========

A python module for accessing Mac OS X keychain data from Python. This is a fork of [Stuart Colville's](http://muffinresearch.co.uk) original [Keychain.py](https://launchpad.net/keychain.py/) project, with additional support for querying keys for specific service names rather than just account names and support for retrieving internet password items.

Usage
------------

Here are some simple usage examples:
    
    # import & instantiate
    import keychain
    k = keychain.Keychain();
    
    # create a new keychain
    k.create_keychain('keychainname','password')
    
    # list available keychains
    k.list_keychains()
    
    # set & get a generic password
    k.set_generic_password('keychainname', 'accountname', 'password')
    k.get_generic_password('keychainname', 'accountname')
    
    # get an internet password (web address is optional, but needed if 'accountname' is used on multiple sites/servers)
    k.get_internet_password('keychainname', 'accountname', 'www.google.com')
    

Installation
------------

Note the keychain module does not __require__ installation, you can simply put the file `keychain.py` in the same folder as your script and import it as above.

If you've already installed [setuptools](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools) you can download and install the keychain module with the following command:

    easy_install http://github.com/spjwebster/keychain.py/tarball/master

If not, [download the tarball](http://github.com/spjwebster/keychain.py/tarball/master), extract it and then:

    cd path/to/extracted/directory
    python setup.py install


Unit tests
----------

Once you've installed the keychain module, you can run the unit tests to make sure that everything is working:

    python tests.py
